# FSM-Traffic-Light-System
We built a five-state traffic light system: Green → Yellow → Red (loop), plus Walk and Power-Save. While in Red, a button press switches to Red+Walk, turning on a white LED for pedestrian crossing. Red+Walk lasts the same duration as Red, then returns to Green. Power-Save turns all lights off to conserve energy.
